# Community iSnobal Model

This project aims to transform the iSnobal physically based snow energy and mass balance
model into a community maintained open science research model. It is in the early 
stages with the aim to bring together operational and scientific end-users to 
improve, share advances, best practices, and use-cases of the model.

This work is the continuation of the initial model development by the [USDA 
Agricultural Research Service Northwest Watershed Research Center](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC)
which we gratefully acknowledge.
